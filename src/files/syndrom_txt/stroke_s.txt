  
   1. Call emergency services. If you’re having stroke symptoms, have someone else call for you. Stay as calm as possible while waiting for emergency help.
   2. If you’re caring for someone else having a stroke, make sure they’re in a safe, comfortable position. Preferably, this should be lying on one side with their head slightly raised and supported in case they vomit.
   3. Check to see if they’re breathing. If they’re not breathing, perform CPR. If they’re having difficulty breathing, loosen any constrictive clothing, such as a tie or scarf.
   4. Talk in a calm, reassuring manner.
   5. Cover them with a blanket to keep them warm.
   6. Don’t give them anything to eat or drink.
   7. If the person is showing any weakness in a limb, avoid moving them.
   8. Observe the person carefully for any change in condition. Be prepared to tell the emergency operator about their symptoms and when they started. Be sure to mention if the person fell or hit their head.
