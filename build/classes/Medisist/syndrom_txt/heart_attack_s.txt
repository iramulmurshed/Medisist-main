    Call 911 or your local emergency number if you think you or someone else is having a heart attack.Have the person sit down, rest, and try to keep calm. Loosen any tight clothing. Ask if the person takes any chest pain medicine, such as nitroglycerin, for a known heart condition, and help them take it.
